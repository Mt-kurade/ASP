# ASP

HELLOOOO, this is team ASP: Pratik, Anubhav, and Saanvi (not really). This is our project called ASP that stands for Artifical Survailence protection (I think, lol)

The goal of this project is to develop a solution for the security gap we identifyed in Bangalore that concerns the safety of people in transit hubs at night. 

Our aim is to create a AI solution that will help in detecting crime and reporting towards police as there is a gap of the lack of motivation of people in banglore to report crime when they see one.
